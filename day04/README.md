## Usage

```bash
ruby first.rb
ruby second.rb
```

## Task

### First

The puzzle is a **word search** where you have to find the word: `XMAS`.
This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words.
<br>
You will have to find **all of instances** of the word `XMAS`.
<br>
Let the puzzle input:

```bash
MMMSXXMASM
MSAMXMSMSA
AMXSXMAAMM
MSAMASMSMX
XMASAMXAMM
XXAMMXXAMA
SMSMSASXSS
SAXAMASAAA
MAMMMXMMMM
MXMXAXMASX
```

The word `XMAS`occurs here a total of 18 times.

### Second

You are now supposed to find two `MAS` in the shape of an `X`. One way to achieve that is like this:
<br>

```bash
M.S
.A.
M.S
```

<br>

With the same input as first task, an `X-MAS` appears now **9** times.

## Personal

This was the first time I wrote `Ruby` code. Its python-like syntax was fun to learn.
