## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> Crystal takes a while to compile
> But the binary is super fast !

```bash
# run immediately
crystal run first.cr
crystal run second.cr

# or compile a binary
bash build.sh
# and execute the binary
./first
./second
```

## Task

[Day05](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/5)

## Personal

This was the first time I wrote `Crystal` code. I love its _rubysh_ friendly syntax and its performances.
<br>
To succeed in this exercise, I thought of linked-lists.
